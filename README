A small calendar app built in Rails that can send out sms reminders.

Uses jQuery calendar that you can use to add events. You can add mobile numbers (of participants) and several reminders (google calendar style) and a sms would be sent to all participant (of participants).

The script lib/send_reminders.rb should be run as a cron job to send out reminders. Its a shell script and not a rake task so its pretty light weight.
